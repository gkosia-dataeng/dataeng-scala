SBT:
    Build tool: Compile, run, test, package a project
    Compile scala code
    Use Apache Ivy for dependency managment
    REPL: evaluate small code to test and debug parts of code

Use the REPL:
    To start the scala interpriter execute sbt console
    Scala is a compiled language so the REPL will generate a class file that will be compiled
    All intermitiate temp files of REPL will be generated to current folder
    It will 

Data types:

    Scala other data types:
        Unit:    void
        Null:    empty
        Nothing: nothing
        Any:     any 
        AnyRef:  any reference

Variables:

    var a : <data type> = <val> ==> with var the variable is muttable
    val a : <data type> = <val> ==> with val the variable is immutable
                                    error: reassignment to val

    var b = {} : code block, the result of the last expression will be assign to the variable

    lazy val q = 100: variable will be evaluated once will used for the first time

Strings:

    String interpolation: inject a value to string
